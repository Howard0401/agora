Programming exercise with basic Person Management. This repository features a Typescript + Jest + Webpack + Vue + Vuex setup.

## Installation
You will need node and yarn

Try `brew install node` or `apt-get install node`. For yarn you want `npm install --global yarn` (or use your package manager)

Then in the project root you can run `yarn` to download and install all dependencies and build the project with `yarn build`.

## Working with the Repository
You might want to open the project in VSCode and start an interactive jest session using `yarn unit:watch`. Your tests will now watch for file changes and retrigger automatically. Type `yarn dev` to start a hot reloading development server. Now you can navigate to `localhost:8080` and see your changes being update as you type.

## Things to do
Once you have accustomed yourself with the setup (granted, it may be a bit overwhelming at first) you might want to add new Features. Such as

1. Adding/Removing Persons
2. Have more fields than the name of a Person (description, age, hobbiesâ€¦)
3. Save your current state to localStorage so it persists across reloads
4. Add Teams and assign Persons to them
5. Add Tags to Persons and make them filterable
6. ?
7. Profit
